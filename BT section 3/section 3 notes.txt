--------------------3.2 Working with data extracts------------------
Data extracts are useful as they keep a copy of data and you dont
work with live data..
So if the data gets changed or something happens you always have a 
backup of the orignal data

To work with extract, 
go to sheet -> right click on data -> use extract -> select settings
-> save the extract file -> right click on data -> use extract

benefits of extract:
using live connection might be slow
data might be changing
it might not be reliable 
so it is advised to use extracts for big data

--------------------3.3 Working with time series------------------
for date time datatype, there are 2 options for the values in the 
dropdown..
1. first one shows that it is a categorical variable (highlighted in blue)
2. second one shows that it is a measure (highlighted in green)


if you want discrete varibales then use the measures and
if you want categories then use the first option (aggrigation is performed based on similar values)
changing the granularity means to drill down into the data
from years to quaters to months to days etc 

you can show or hide the points by going into color settings and choose the marker settings

--------------------3.4 understanding aggregation, granularity and level of detail------------------
measures get aggregated in tableau and dimensions specify the level of granularity

if we dont want aggregation and want each and every data then 
go to analysis, uncheck aggregate measures.

if you want to change the level of granularity, 
you can add some other variables acc to which you want the granularity to be changed in marks section

if you want to change the granularity without changing the visual then use the details tab under the marks section
you can also change the aggregation type by playing with aggregation types

--------------------3.5 Creating a area chart and learning about highlighting------------------
highlighing is the feature wherein you can select the different categories to get out meaningful insights about data
eg. when we click on one of the genders, we can see the chart for specific genders only
we cannot highlight the details so we can use color or shape to get the legend for specific categories and then we can use the 
"Highlight Selected Items" opiton for making more sense of the data

highlighting is used to analyse data in data analysis.
we have to choose our marks wisely and select the appropriate type 
for the chart we have to create

--------------------3.6 Adding Filter and Quick Filter------------------
The filters tab is helpful to add filter.
It acts as where / having clause in the database
just drag your measure or dimension into the filter condition and then select the appropriate condition

Quick Filter is used to make the things quick.. you dont need to open the condition everytime when you want to analyse the chart
right click on the filter and select show quick filter
