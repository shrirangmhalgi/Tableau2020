------------------4.2 Joining data in tableau---------------------
by default there is a relationship which is present in new tableau
however, you can join the data by double clicking on the data file
then by dragging the other table into the table area.
if you see 2 circles then you have successfully joined 2 tables
there are various types of joins available
1. inner join
2. left outer join
3. right outer join
4. full outer join
you can perform multiple joins same like the database

if one of the table contains duplicate data for joins, 
then the row is duplicated same like the database

------------------4.3 Creating a map. Working with hierarchies---------------------
we can create hierarchies in tableau
to do so, just drag child element on to parent element and hierarchy will be created.

be careful not to aggregate data for different years unless required

filter, aggregate, calculated fields, maps, etc

------------------4.4 Creating a Scatter plot and Apply filter accross many different worksheets---------------------
by default we get aggregated measures 
if in any case, you want to disaggregate it then 
go to analysis tab and check off the aggregate tab

or we can leave the aggregate function on and add stuff to details

to apply multiple filter, you can do is 
right click on 1 filter and say apply to worksheets -> all using this datasource

if you want to show any detail in granularity then we can use colors and details 
scatter plot is created when you take 2 measures in rows and columns

------------------4.5 Creating our 1st dashboard---------------------
dashboard is more of a visual kind of representation
dashboard is used to do data investigation

to adjust, change the size of the element on the sheet
the filters which are not useful and are for asthetic purposes can be removed

------------------4.6 Adding an interactive action - Filter---------------------
making dashboard interactive means giving user an option to drill down into the data
to make it interactive, 
go to dashboard -> Actions
then you can choose add action to add different filters to your dashboard

to add a automatic action, 
click on the map settings in the dashboard -> use as filter

in actions, there is source, target, then type of action (hover, select, etc)
source is the source of action
target is the target sheets to which actions is applied
actions is the event on which the action is applied
hoving might be more convinient in certain cases


using the menuu features you can toggle the dashboard manually
you can select multiple values too.
to do so press control and click
or you can use different types of selections
lasso is useful as it gives ability to freely select any region 

------------------4.7 Adding an interactive action - Highlighting---------------------
when you click on certain section and then if you want to 
highlight some specific part then you use highlighting action in the dashboard

to apply highlighting 
go to dashboard -> actions -> add new -> highlighting

highlighting is little different from filter action as if there is multiple data 
for some specific item then it wont get highlighted
To overcome this, you need to use appropriate granularity for your data in your sheets

action filters work at data level. they filter the data and then supplied to dashboard
filters dont take out data so we need to be carful with the granularity of the data
