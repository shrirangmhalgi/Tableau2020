2.2 connecting tableau to a data file
A csv file is considered as a text file.
data can come from many files or many tabs or different types of files.

you can change the data types of the fields while importing the data
by clicking on small icon above the column name and select the appropriate type.

in the sheet tab, there  is a data column to the left.
we can do many things such as viewing the data, etc by right-clicking on the data source name

if you want to connect more data then under the data drop down menu you can connect or you can go to data source tab in bottom left corner or right click on the name of the data and choose edit

2.3 navigating tableau
sheets are the tableaus working area
data area is on the left which contains the fields 
and the working area is on the right which contains the space to create the worksheets

dimensions are independent variables and units are dependent variables

2.4 Creating Calculated fields
clear sheet is there to clear the entire contents of the sheet 
it is used to clear the entire contents of the sheet
shortcut is alt + shift + backspace

to create a calculated field, 
right click on data pane -> create calculated field -> enter name and enter the formula
click on apply	
if there is a little equal sign before the # symbol then it indicates that it is a calculated field 

if you drag it on the existing columns then it replaces it (small hack)

sometimes data doesnt contain the exact information. It has the information there but it is hidden somewhere in the data
tableau has insanely large variety to create calculated fields
------------------------------------------------------------

2.5 adding colors
datascience is not about crunching numbers, but it is a form of a art. So having good form of colors and arts is also important

by clicking on color you can change the colors of the whole chart to any color, apply border change the opacity, etc
you can drag the any attribute to the color panel and then you will get color effects

Tip : 
1. IF you drag continous values on the the color then it gives you the hue (light to dark shades).
2. IF you drag discrete values on the the color then it gives you the discrete colors (different shades).

click on colors -> edit colors and then select the color pallete you want
